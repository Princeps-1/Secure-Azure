# My Work
This is me building multiple Azure environments and then securing them! I have taken some inspiration from work and what I would like to see!

## Projects

The projects I have done listed in order

### Secure Azure
  My initial project in which I spun up a tenant on Azure and created the following:
    - Resource Group
    - Virtual Machine
    - Storage Account
    - Virtual Network
  Bear in mind these were created using the defaults from scratch so that I could implement all the security best practices after the fact.
